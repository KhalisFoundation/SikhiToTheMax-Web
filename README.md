# SikhiToTheMax Website

Originally developed by SHARE Charity UK, SikhiToTheMax has become a defacto standard for keertans and gurdwaras around the world to display gurbani on screens for sangat to join into the depth of Gurbani and translations.

SikhiToTheMax is now developed by Khalis Foundation as seva to the panth and is working hard to ensure it lives up to its name.
Sevadaars are currently working hard to build newer version of SikhiToTheMax website using modern web technologies.

Website: http://www.SikhiToTheMax.org

Developer: Khalis Foundation and sevadars (see commiters for more details)

## Build Instructions

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) & [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

* Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhalisFoundation/SikhiToTheMax-Web/
```

You should now see a `SikhiToTheMax-Web` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd SikhiToTheMax-Web/
```

* Step 2: Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

This will use `npm` that is included with `nodejs` to install project depedencies.

* Step 3: Start the project.

```bash
npm start
```

This will run a bunch of build tools and a `nodejs` server to deploy the code locally.

* Step 4: Access your local dev environment of the SikhiToTheMax website

```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
