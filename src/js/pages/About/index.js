    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
      Originally developed by Bhai Tarsem Singh of SHARE charity UK, SikhiToTheMax has become
      a defacto standard for keertans and gurdwaras around the world to display gurbani on screens
      for sangat to join into the depth of Gurbani and translations.
      <br />
      <br />
      SikhiToTheMax is now developed by Khalis Foundation as seva to the panth and is working hard
      to ensure it lives up to its name.
